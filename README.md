# Iris
Read me:

This project leverages the renowned Iris dataset, a benchmark in machine learning. The dataset includes 150 observations of three Iris flower species (**Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**) with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The primary objective is to develop a machine learning model to classify the species based on these features.

### **Project Steps**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    - Conducted statistical analysis and visualizations to understand feature distributions.
    - Used box plots, correlation matrices, and scatter plots to identify relationships between variables.
      
2. **Data Preprocessing**
    - Scaled the features to ensure uniformity.
    - Verified the dataset for missing or anomalous values.
      
3. **Modeling and Training**
    - Implemented supervised classification models:
        - Logistic Regression.
        - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
        - Decision Trees.
    - Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets for evaluation.
      
4. **Evaluation**
    - Measured performance metrics such as accuracy, recall, and F1-score.
    - Applied cross-validation to mitigate overfitting risks.
      
5. **Results and Insights**
    - The KNN model achieved a classification accuracy of 98%, showcasing its effectiveness for this dataset.
    - Visualizations highlighted the clear separability of the **Setosa** species due to its distinct feature patterns.
